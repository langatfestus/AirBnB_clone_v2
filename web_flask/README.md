Flask is a popular Python web framework used to build web applications and APIs. It is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use. To get you started, here's a working knowledge of Flask:

Installation:
You can install Flask using pip, Python's package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

pip install flask

Basic Application Structure:
In Flask, you typically create a Python script to define your application. The basic structure of a Flask app looks like this:
python

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Creating Routes:
Flask uses the @app.route() decorator to define routes. A route corresponds to a specific URL and HTTP method. When a user visits a particular URL, the corresponding function will be executed.

Handling HTTP Methods:
By default, the @app.route() decorator handles HTTP GET requests. You can specify other HTTP methods like POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., by passing the methods parameter.

@app.route('/post', methods=['POST'])
def create_post():
    # Function to handle POST request
